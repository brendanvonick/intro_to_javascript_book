/*  Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a manageable
    and predictable manner. You can use 'try/catch' to capture exceptions and
    deal with them in some manner in the catch block of the statement. It
    allows programmers to deal with problems in code that don't hinder the
    program or function from finishing.
