/*  The code logs 'Not Empty' to the console. It does this because an array is
    passed as an argument into the function isArrayEmpty. Even though there are
    no elements in the array, it's still is an array, it still exists and
    therefore has a truthy value. Because of it's truthy value, the the first
    portion of the if/else statement is executed. */
