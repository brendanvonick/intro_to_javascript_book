/*  The code logs 1 to the console. The value of 'bar' is initially set at 1 in
    global scope. The function foo creates a new variable 'bar' that is an
    entirely new entity and is limited to the scope of the function. Therefore
    executing the foo function does not affect the output and the value 1 is
    logged to the console. */
