/*  No, no error is yielded from this code block. Even though FOO is declared
    twice in this program with the const keyword, the declarations are made in
    different scopes; one is global, and one is block, making them 2 completely
    different variables. The FOO value of 'qux' is limited to the scope inside
    the block and is inaccessible outside the code block. Therefore the FOO
    value of 'bar' is what is logged to the console. */
