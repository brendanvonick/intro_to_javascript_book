/*  This program logs 'bar' to the console. It does so because the variable
    'foo' is declared with value 'bar' in global scope before the code block.
    Inside the code block a new variable 'foo' is declared with the let keyword,
    however this variable has let variable has block scope, limiting its use to
    inside the code block. Because it's scope ends when the code block ends,
    console.log(foo) logs the global variable for foo, 'bar', to the console. */
